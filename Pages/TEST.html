						<h3 class="articletitle">What Does Domestic Violence Look Like?</h3><!--Add an h3 tag to hold title of first article-->
			  			
						<p class="article">Domestic abuse is a serious problem that affects women all over the world. It can be difficult to identify, as abusers often use subtle and manipulative tactics to control and harm their victims. However, recognizing the signs and symptoms of domestic abuse is crucial in order to help victims get the support and resources they need to escape and heal.</p><br>

						<p class="article">One of the most common signs of domestic abuse is physical violence. This can include hitting, punching, slapping, choking, and other forms of physical harm. If a woman has unexplained injuries or bruises, it is possible that she is experiencing domestic abuse.</p><br>
							
						<p class="article">However, physical violence is not the only form of abuse that women may experience. Emotional abuse is another common tactic used by abusers. This can include verbal attacks, humiliation, manipulation, and controlling behavior. Women who are being emotionally abused may feel like they are constantly walking on eggshells or living in fear of their partner's reactions.</p><br>
							
						<p class="article">Financial abuse is another sign of domestic abuse. This occurs when the abuser controls all of the finances and prevents the victim from accessing money or resources. Women who are experiencing financial abuse may be forced to ask for permission to spend money or may be prevented from working outside the home.</p><br>
							
						<p class="article">Sexual abuse is also a common form of domestic abuse. This can include rape, unwanted sexual touching, or coercion. Women who are being sexually abused may feel like they have no control over their own bodies and may experience significant trauma and shame as a result.</p><br>
							
						<p class="article">It is important to note that not all signs of domestic abuse are physical or overtly harmful. In some cases, abusers may use subtle tactics to control and manipulate their victims. For example, an abuser may isolate a woman from her friends and family, making her feel like she has no one to turn to. They may also use threats or intimidation to control their partner's behavior.</p><br>
							
						<p class="article">Should you suspect that someone you know may be experiencing domestic abuse, it is important to approach the situation with sensitivity and care. Let the person know that you are there for them and that you support them. Encourage them to seek help and offer to connect them with local resources and support services.</p><br>
							
						<p class="article">Remember, domestic abuse is never the victim's fault. It is a form of violence and control that can have devastating consequences for women and their families. By recognizing the signs and symptoms of domestic abuse and taking action to support victims, we can help create a world where all women are safe, respected, and empowered.</p><br><!--Add a paragraph tag and insert text of first article-->
